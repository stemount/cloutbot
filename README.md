# Clout Bot

[**VIEW THE PROJECT BOARD**](https://github.com/stemount/cloutbot/projects/1)

This bot was previously named `community-discord-bot` as this project does start off as a Discord bot but ideally this should actually be useable on any sort of incoming chat stream (MS Teams, Slack) - why not.

### Core Idea

A useful bot that lets you validate people who help, contribute and thank with a star.

Similar to XP based solutions like Arcane, let's take this back to the IRC days when it was simply

```
<blahperson> stemount++
<another> copy++
<yo> sleepybear++
```

### Purpose of this project

There are a few quirks to this project:

- [ ] The bot will be developed in parallel tracks in a handful of languages [Issue #6](https://github.com/stemount/cloutbot/issues/6)
  The whole purpose of this is so those who prefer a specific tech stack are welcome to join and contribute.
- [ ] There will be "commonalities" between the implementations, e.g. we will use `docker-compose.yml` to run the bot in all languages we support [going from a local Docker box to production](https://github.com/stemount/cloutbot/issues/13)
